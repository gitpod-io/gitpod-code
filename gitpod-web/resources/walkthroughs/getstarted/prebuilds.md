# Prebuilds

Download & install dependencies, run build scripts, you name it - tell Gitpod which tasks to run and it takes care of them **before** you start a new developer environment so you donâ€™t have to wait for any of that.

When new code is pushed to the repository, Gitpod automatically prepares a new workspace based on the latest code.

By the time you start your next workspace, everything is installed, compiled and ready for you to write code.
