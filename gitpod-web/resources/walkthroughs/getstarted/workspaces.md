# Workspaces

When you work with Gitpod, you use a new workspace for each task you work on. This is different from your local environment where you have only one and maintain it over time.

Gitpod workspaces are automated and disposable, they are ephemeral workspaces.

## Benefits of ephemeral workspaces

### Latest code

Each new workspace contains the latest code. There's no need for you to take care of that.

As an added bonus, if you open a Gitpod workspace from an issue URL, Gitpod automatically creates a branch for you! All you need to do is write the code, commit & push.

### Latest dependencies

Each new workspace also has the most up-to-date versions of app & operating system dependencies. Another thing you don't have to worry about.

### Work in parallel

Say you're working on a feature and a team member asks you to review their pull request. Start a new workspace, review the code, close the workspace - and you're back in your feature environment where you continue to work.
