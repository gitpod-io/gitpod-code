# VS Code desktop support

If you like the idea of ephemeral workspaces, but prefer to develop code in your local VS Code, we've got you covered.

Depending on the version of VS Code you have installed locally, use one of the following links to start your VS Code and connect to the currently running workspace:
* [Open in VS Code](command:gitpod.openInStable)
* [Open in VS Code Insiders](command:gitpod.openInInsiders)
