# The terminal

Gitpod is more than just an editor - it's everything you need to develop, test & debug your application.

With that, you also have access to a terminal, including Docker support.

Let's open a new terminal and run the following command in the terminal:

```bash
docker run hello-world
```

Alternatively, [click here](command:gitpod.welcome.createTerminalAndRunDockerCommand) to perform the above automatically.

Just like you used the `hello-world` Docker image, you can containerize your own application right on Gitpod.

To exit a terminal, type `exit` and hit Enter.
