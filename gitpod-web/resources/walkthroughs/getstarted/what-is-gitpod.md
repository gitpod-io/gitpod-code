# What is Gitpod?

With Gitpod, you spin up fresh, automated dev environments for each task, in the cloud, in seconds.

- Develop a new feature? Start a new workspace.
- Review a pull request? Start a new workspace.
- Fix a bug in production? Start a new workspace.

You can even run multiple workspaces in parallel and they are 100% isolated from each other.

## User interface

As you notice, Gitpod looks & feels like VS Code - except it runs in a browser. On Gitpod, you can install extensions, apply themes and use a terminal just as you're used to from your local computer.

## Features

Use the steps on the left side to learn more about the following features:

* Prebuilds
* Workspaces
* The terminal
* Ports
* VS Code desktop support

## Browser extension

To be most productive with Gitpod, it is best if you [install the browser extension](https://www.gitpod.io/docs/browser-extension). It will add a convenient "Gitpod" button when you look at your repo, an issue or a pull request.
