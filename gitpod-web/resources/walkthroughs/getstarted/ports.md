# Ports

If your application listens on any port, e.g. a web application, Gitpod provides a URL for you to access your application.

A list of ports is available in the "PortsView" tab near by Terminal tab. [Click here to open PortsView.](command:gitpod.portsView.focus)

_Note_: To get back to the list of files in your project, click the "Explorer" icon on the left-hand side.

## Documentation

To learn more about ports and how to configure them, please [refer to the documentation](https://www.gitpod.io/docs/configure/workspaces/ports).
